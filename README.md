# Discord_WoW_AH_Bot_Public
Use Discord to look at WoW Auction house data

This is something I made a while back and for some reason I couldn't recall where I left it. So it's a re-upload. I don't think it works anymore because Blizzards and possibly Discords underlying API's have changed. However, this is a project fully created by myself and shows my coding style and how much I comment (probably too much) though looking at the code five years later, I think those comments achieved their purpose and I can understand what each code portion was ment to do. :)
